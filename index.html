<h1>Just a small project...right?</h1>
<div>
I was laughing with a colleague that I have a million thoughts and nowhere to put them unless I want to post to a premade blog like Medium (no shade).
<br>
And then I was thinking that I've helped teach courses in web design and I just never get around to making a website but I DO have a lot of stuff I'd love to host.
<br>
And then I was laughing that maybe I'd come out of this weekend with a website.
<br>
And then suddenly I was making a website.
<br>
Whoops. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

<div>
Skeletal thoughts
<ul>
	<li>I dunno how exactly this should be organized yet...</li>
	<li>Stressful...</li>
	<li>So I guess it's all just an unliked pile for now ðŸ¥°</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
What am I gonna put here??
<ul>
	<li>Pages for my RPG characters! They deserve to be somewhere.</li>
		<ul>
	      <li>Heiassa Duumn'ael, Imperator. Also a fae. Live ain't simple.</li>
	      <li>Lady Ironfist, tiefling ranger/rogue with a lil baby tressym (Grim!)</li>
	      <li>Shai Meadowlark, minotaur paladin with a big bobcat friend, Candytuft</li>
    	</ul>
	<li>Nice things noticed (on walks? around? in people?)</li>
	<li>ðŸ˜» C A T W A T C H ðŸ˜» </li>
	<li>Current guiding principles (maybe also past ones? progress on them? idk) </li>

</ul>

<h1>Just a small project...right?</h1>
<p>I was laughing with a colleague that I have a million thoughts and nowhere to put them unless I want to post to a premade blog like Medium (no shade).

And then I was laughing that I've helped teach courses in web design and I just never get around to making a website.

And then I was laughing that maybe I'd come out of this weekend with a website.

And then suddenly I was making a website.

Whoops.</p>
